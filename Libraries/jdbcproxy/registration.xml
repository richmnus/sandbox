   The GreenHat JDBC driver does not need to register against a specific domain
   or environment. By default it will proxy for all domains/environments. If
   you wish to restrict its use then add <domain> entries based on the example
   below. Each domain may have 0 or more environments.
  -->

    When the proxy registers with Rational Test Control Panel, it can gather usage statistics immediately.

  <!--
   By default, the JDBC driver will intercept all of the JDBC connections that
   the application makes. To explicitly enable or disable the driver for specific
   connections you can use <includes>, <excludes> or a combination of <includes>
   and <excludes> sections.
   
   Each include or exclude is treated as a case-insensitive prefix for connection
   URLs, so you may either specify the complete URL, or you can control several
   similar connections with a prefix.
   
   The order of <includes> and <excludes> sections in this file does not affect
   the outcome: all includes are considered first, and then all excludes are applied.
   Note that an empty <includes> section disables the driver.
